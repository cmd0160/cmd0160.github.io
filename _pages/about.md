I’m a Machine Learning Engineer with a strong focus on building scalable, reliable, and production-ready data systems. My work spans the full ML lifecycle — from exploratory data analysis and feature engineering to distributed model training, deployment, and monitoring — with hands-on experience across Databricks, AWS, Spark, Ray, and modern Python/R ecosystems.

I’m currently developing machine learning pipelines that blend classical modeling, neural networks, and generative AI. Recent projects include anomaly-detection systems on Databricks, distributed inference workflows, ensemble models for stock-movement prediction, and RAG applications leveraging LangChain, vector stores, and retrieval graphs. On the R side, I regularly work with tidyverse, caret, sparklyr, and R Markdown for statistical modeling, forecasting, and data storytelling.

My background bridges data science, software engineering, and cloud architecture. I’ve deployed ML models to both SageMaker and Databricks, built asset-bundle deployment workflows, optimized Spark jobs across clusters, and designed end-to-end pipelines with modular preprocessing, filtering, modeling, merging, and reporting components. I’m also experienced in packaging ML systems, writing clean tests with pytest, and tuning distributed execution using multiprocessing and Ray.

Beyond engineering, I’m passionate about helping others understand data. I enjoy studying the internals of Python, exploring computer architecture at a low level, and creating clear explanations, diagrams, and presentations for technical concepts. I’m also currently pursuing a Master of Science in Data Science, where I work on statistical modeling, machine learning, forecasting, and applied analytics in both Python and R.

Outside of work, I’m a musician, a builder, and a lifelong learner — interested in everything from sheet-music recognition models to woodworking projects, meal-generation apps, and meditation and mindfulness practices.

My goal is simple: build practical, elegant, and well-engineered machine learning systems — and learn something new every day in the process.
